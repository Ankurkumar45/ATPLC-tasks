				<p>My name is Ankur Kumar Dwivedi. The name of my college is Motihari College of Engineering, Motihari. I am a 2nd year B.tech Student.</p>
				<p>I love my college a lot because it possesses all the qualities of an ideal college. We have excellent course curriculum and faculty members. Our lecturers hold a respectable place in the societies.</p>
				<p>Dr. Abhay Kumar Jha is the principal of my college and he is very particular in appointing the lecturers. This is the reason nobody takes tuition classes after the college hours like students of other colleges. It is my firm belief that education is the best way to enlighten young minds and it can only be imparted in a good environment having prosperous thinking. My college has all what it takes.</p>
